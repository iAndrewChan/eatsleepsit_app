They decided that an Emergency Night Shelter was required to provide the first rung on the ladder out of homelessness. Volunteers and money were needed. So the news spread, mainly by word of mouth, and the public responded. But nothing could happen until a building was found from which the Night Shelter could operate.",chair@juliantrust.org.uk,https://twitter.com/JulianTrust,0117 924 4604,51.46225,-2.584922

We believe that the best way to help homeless people is to give them a secure base from which they can build their lives.
 
 We work with the support of our directors, staff and volunteers to build temporary accommodation, to be used by residents while they access the help they need to secure a permanent home.

 In the mid-1980s, a passionate group of social workers and community psychiatric nurses recognised that many people were in hospital not just because of their mental health problems, but because they had nowhere else to go.
 
 Housing initiatives at that time didn’t give people the mental health and practical support they needed once out of hospital. The group decided to set up a housing association where the emotional and mental wellbeing of each individual was central.
 
 The founders found landlords with available properties to rent, and persuaded people to volunteer their time for free. In 1987, we officially became Second Step, named in recognition of providing a step away from hospital, and one towards recovery and the hope of a better future.",admin@second-step.co.uk,https://twitter.com/wearesecondstep,0117 909 6630,51.460245,-2.587492

 Our 40-bed hostel, Passage House, was officially opened on 1 March 2000. In the financial year 2015-2016, 67 rough sleepers moved off the streets and into Passage House.
 
 Our 16 self-contained studio flats in Montfort House have staff support on site and specialise in helping very long term rough sleepers.
 
 We welcome and treat clients with respect and dignity, and find out what they need and want. We offer professional and appropriate advice and help according to the client’s needs and aspirations. We agree an action plan with clients which is time limited with the aim of supporting clients out of homelessness.
 
 Of the over £4 million a year it costs to keep The Passage going, only 33% is funded from statutory sources; the rest comes from donations from individuals, church organisations, charitable trusts and companies.",info@passage.org.uk,https://twitter.com/PassageCharity,020 7821 6801,51.492758,-0.139642
